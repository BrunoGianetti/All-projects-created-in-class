# Here you see my first steps on Data Science

I analyse a Kaggle's Dataset with 5000 iMDB info between movies and credits. All in .CSV files.

# What you find?

You find a .py with pure code and a .ipynb notebook running in Google Colab or Jupyters Notebook.There are graphics and tables generated with pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

# See this! ðŸ‘‡
